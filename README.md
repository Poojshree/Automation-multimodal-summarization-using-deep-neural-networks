Along with growth of Internet and big data, making people over whelmed by large information, huge content(video ,audio) 
and document in the internet. Video summarization technologies aim to create a concise and complete synopsis by selecting the most informative 
parts of the video content by using  ResNet-18 for feature extraction and with the help of temporal interest proposals generated for the video sequences, 
generates a video summary.  in addition proposes techniques to annotate and generate textual sum-maries of the videos using recurrent networks. 
In addition with these Using ASR to generating audio summaries and using NLP approaches to generating text summaries
.

With the dramatic growth of the Internet, people are overwhelmed by the tremendous amount of online information and documents. 
Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information content and overall meaning. 
Audio summarization seeks to identify the most important content within audio and then to generate a condensed form, suitable for the needs of a given task.
With the advent of technology, the number of videos and the amount of digital video data being generated has enormously increased.
Video summarization is important in order to process this huge data.
Video summarization aims to get concise and short summaries of large-scale videos that are representative of original videos
